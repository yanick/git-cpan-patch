=head1 SYNOPSIS

    % git-cpan send-patch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command runs C<git-cpan format-patch> and then if there is one patch file
runs C<git-cpan send-email>.

Multiple patches are not sent because C<git send-email> creates a separate
message for each patch file, resulting in multiple tickets.
