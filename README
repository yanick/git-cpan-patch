This is a series of scripts developped for the 
article 'CPAN Patching with Git' that I wrote
for the Winter 2008 edition (aka issue 5.1) 
of the The Perl Review[1].  

The goal of those scripts is to make trivially
easy to grab any distribution off CPAN, gitify
its latest version, hack on it and send back
patches to the maintainer.  For now the only
documentation is in the article, but I'll 
eventually inject some documentation in
the scripts themselves (in the meantime, I
recommend to subscribe to the TPR :-) )
